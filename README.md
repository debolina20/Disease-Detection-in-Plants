**PROBLEM**
The Disease Detection in Plants is a Image Classification project using Deep Learning techniques. The idea is to enable a machine to detect the characteristics of a plant and based on their images. This will help to detect if the plant is healthy or diseased based on the color, shape and texture.

The Kaggle dataset of Disease Detection in Plants have been taken to train the model.
